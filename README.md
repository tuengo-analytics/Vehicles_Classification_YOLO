# Vehicles_Classification_YOLO

Machine learning applied in computer vision is a powerful tool to detect and classifying objects. Performing these tasks in real time requires a fast machine learning algorithm. In this project, a convolution neural network (CNN) called YOLO (You Only Look Once) is used to demonstrate the speed of detection and classification in real time. The objects we want to detect in this project are the types of servicing vehicles (UPS, FedEx, USPS, police cars, etc.) captured by a dash board camera.

The source codes in references below have been used in this project to train a YOLO model to recognize 8 types of service vehicles.
